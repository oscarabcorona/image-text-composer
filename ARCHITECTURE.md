# Refactored Architecture - SOLID & DRY Principles

## Overview

The Image Text Composer has been refactored to follow SOLID principles and eliminate code duplication (DRY). The new architecture separates concerns, uses dependency injection, and provides better testability and maintainability.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each service and component now has a single, well-defined responsibility:

- **CanvasService**: Manages canvas operations only
- **LayerService**: Handles layer management
- **TextService**: Manages text-specific operations
- **HistoryService**: Controls undo/redo functionality
- **AutoSaveService**: Handles persistence
- **SelectionService**: Manages selection state
- **SnapService**: Controls snap-to-center functionality

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The system is open for extension but closed for modification:

- New command types can be added without modifying existing commands
- New services can be added to the ServiceProvider
- The CommandFactory can be extended with new command types

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
All services implement their respective interfaces and can be substituted:

```typescript
// Any implementation of ICanvasService can be used
interface ICanvasService {
  initialize(canvas: HTMLCanvasElement): fabric.Canvas;
  // ... other methods
}
```

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Interfaces are focused and specific:

- `ICanvasService` - Canvas operations only
- `ILayerService` - Layer management only
- `ITextService` - Text operations only
- etc.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules depend on abstractions:

- Commands depend on `IServiceProvider` interface, not concrete implementations
- Components use services through interfaces
- CommandFactory creates commands with injected dependencies

## Key Improvements

### 1. Service Architecture
```
ServiceProvider
├── CanvasService
├── LayerService
├── TextService
├── HistoryService
├── AutoSaveService
├── SelectionService
└── SnapService
```

### 2. Command Pattern with DI
```typescript
// Before: Commands directly accessed store
class AddTextLayerCommand {
  execute() {
    const state = useEditorStore.getState();
    // Direct store manipulation
  }
}

// After: Commands receive dependencies
class AddTextLayerCommand extends BaseCommand {
  constructor(services: IServiceProvider) {
    super(services);
  }
  
  execute() {
    // Use injected services
    this.services.layers.addLayer(/*...*/);
  }
}
```

### 3. DRY Utilities
Common operations extracted to utility functions:

- **layerUtils**: Layer finding, sorting, naming
- **canvasUtils**: Scaling, centering, rendering
- **validationUtils**: Input validation, sanitization

### 4. Custom Hooks
Reusable logic encapsulated in hooks:

- `useEditorServices`: Service lifecycle management
- `useCanvasEvents`: Canvas event handling
- `useKeyboardShortcuts`: Keyboard interactions
- `useImageUpload`: Image upload logic

## Benefits

1. **Testability**: Each service can be tested in isolation
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features without modifying existing code
4. **Reusability**: Utilities and hooks can be reused across components
5. **Type Safety**: Strong interfaces ensure type safety
6. **Performance**: Services can be optimized independently

## Migration Guide

To use the refactored architecture:

1. Import the refactored store:
```typescript
import { useEditorStoreRefactored } from '@/lib/editor/store-refactored';
```

2. Initialize services:
```typescript
const { services, initializeServices } = useEditorStoreRefactored();

useEffect(() => {
  if (canvasRef.current) {
    initializeServices(canvasRef.current);
  }
}, []);
```

3. Use services for operations:
```typescript
// Add text layer
const command = commandFactory.createAddTextLayerCommand('Hello');
services.history.execute(command);

// Update properties
const updateCommand = commandFactory.createUpdateTextPropertiesCommand(
  layerId,
  { fontSize: 32 }
);
services.history.execute(updateCommand);
```

## Testing Example

Services can now be easily tested:

```typescript
describe('LayerService', () => {
  let canvasService: CanvasService;
  let layerService: LayerService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    canvasService = new CanvasService();
    layerService = new LayerService(canvasService);
  });

  test('should add layer', () => {
    const textObject = new fabric.IText('Test');
    const layer = layerService.addLayer(textObject);
    
    expect(layer.id).toBeDefined();
    expect(layerService.getAllLayers()).toHaveLength(1);
  });
});
```

## Future Enhancements

The refactored architecture makes it easy to add:

1. **Plugin System**: Services can be extended with plugins
2. **State Persistence**: Different storage backends (IndexedDB, etc.)
3. **Collaborative Editing**: Services can sync with remote state
4. **Advanced Undo/Redo**: Branching history, selective undo
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Service-level metrics
