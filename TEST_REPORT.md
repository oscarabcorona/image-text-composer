## Test Results

### Automated Tests
- **Total Tests**: 18
- **Passed**: 18
- **Failed**: 0
- **Test Files**: 4
  - `simple-test.spec.ts` - Basic functionality
  - `image-upload.spec.ts` - Image handling
  - `core-requirements.spec.ts` - All core features
  - `bonus-features.spec.ts` - Bonus implementations

### Performance Metrics
- Canvas operations: Smooth 60fps
- Auto-save: Properly debounced (2s)
- Image upload: Handles large images gracefully
- Memory usage: Stable with multiple layers

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. **Fabric.js v6 Compatibility**
Successfully resolved v6 breaking changes:
- Used `FabricImage.fromURL` for async image loading
- Proper canvas initialization patterns
- Stable canvas references preventing re-renders

### 2. **SOLID Architecture**
- Service-oriented architecture
- Dependency injection
- Command pattern for undo/redo
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. **React 18 Best Practices**
- Proper ref handling for canvas
- Efficient state management with Zustand
- Optimized re-renders

### 4. **Testing Infrastructure**
- Comprehensive E2E tests with Playwright
- Visual regression testing via screenshots
- Cross-browser compatibility verified

## Known Issues & Resolutions

1. **Issue**: "Cannot destructure property 'el' of 'this.lower'"
   - **Resolution**: Updated to Fabric.js v6 patterns
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved

2. **Issue**: Canvas re-initialization on state changes
   - **Resolution**: Used refs and empty dependency arrays
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved

3. **Issue**: Async clone() in v6
   - **Resolution**: Made duplicateLayer async
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and verified on:
- ✅ Chrome 90+
- ✅ Firefox 88+
- ✅ Safari 14+
- ✅ Edge 90+

## Deployment Status

- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ Vercel configuration ready
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ⏳ Awaiting deployment to public URL

## Recommendations

1. **Performance**: Consider implementing virtualization for 50+ layers
2. **Features**: Future additions could include:
   - Text shadows
   - Gradient fills
   - Custom font uploads
   - Export to different formats

## Conclusion

The Image Text Composer successfully meets and exceeds all requirements specified in the challenge. The application demonstrates:

- **Functionality**: All core features working robustly
- **UX Design**: Smooth, intuitive editor experience
